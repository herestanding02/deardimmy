        <h2> To the kindest person i've ever met</h2><br>
        <p>Before March ends, let me close this month by saying, happiest birthday Dimmy. I know it is too late, but aren't we getting older every second? But march is your month, so happy belated birthday to you. Here's the thing,  im not good at stringing words, so i will tell you all of my wishes for you. Dimmy, i hope everything you do and every step you take will always be protected by God. Nothing is more important than being healthy, so please take care of your body and be in good condition ( we know "mens sana in corpore sano" is right, right? :p). Dimmy, i wish nothing, but i pray the most extraordinary things in this world will always come to you. Keep up the excellent work you do in college, i'm so proud of you. Dimmy, thank you for letting this annoying girl into your life. Little did you know, you taught me many things, and im grateful for that. Dimmy, your presence itself is a gift, happy birthday.</p>
